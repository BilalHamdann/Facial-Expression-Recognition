# Facial Expression Recognition using Classical and Deep Learning Techniques

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal

The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate multiple approaches for classifying facial expressions using the FER2013 dataset. We explore both traditional feature-based methods (HOG, LBP) combined with machine learning models, as well as a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The ultimate goal is to determine which technique offers the best performance in recognizing emotions from facial images.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

- **Dataset**: [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- **Description**: A publicly available dataset consisting of 48x48 grayscale images of faces. Each image is labeled with one of the following 7 emotions:
  - Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- **Split**:
  - Training set
  - Validation set (created from training set)
  - Test set
